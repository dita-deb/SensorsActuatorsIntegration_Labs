# Lab 6: Servo Motor Control
- Objective: To have the student experiment with an integrated potentiometer/9g servo
motor/Serial Monitor display circuit wherein the potentiometer voltage represents our
“sensed” input and the 9g Servo Motor position and Serial Monitor angle display our
“actuated” outputs.
