# Lab 4: Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- Objective: To have the student experiment with a simple temperature sensor circuit wherein
the device temperature represents our “sensed” input and the displayed data our “actuated”
output. Thereafter, you will explore the response time of the sensor and compare it to the
actual manufacturer specifications
