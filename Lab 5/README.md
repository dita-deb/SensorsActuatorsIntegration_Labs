# Lab 5: Passive Buzzer Control
- Objective: To have the student experiment with a simple integrated potentiometer &
piezoelectric buzzer circuit wherein a potentiometer rotation represents our “sensed” input
and the corresponding buzzer tone represents our “actuated” output. You will also print the
current frequency to the Serial Monitor
