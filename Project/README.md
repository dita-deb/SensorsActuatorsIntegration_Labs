# PROJECT
## Red Light - Green Light

### Description:
The objective of this project is to implement “Red Light - Green Light” game environment from Squid
Game movie using Arduino, multiple sensors, and actuators. The basic principle of this game is one person
stands at one end of the field with a group of players standing on the other side. Facing away from the
group, the lone player turns back and front saying “Green Light” and “Red Light” as fast or as slow as
he/she wants. The group can only move forward during “Green Light” period (when the lone player is not
looking at) and stand still during “Red Light” period. If you reach the other side without getting caught,
you win. But if you're moving while the lone player turns to look at everyone else or the time is up, you're
eliminated.
